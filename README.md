Question
        Use this attached dataset to make a  crop recommendation model. (Target variable is "Label")
Marking Criteria :-
EDA performed
Use all the different models that you studied till now and can be used on this dataset and take out their performance metrics ( accuracy_score )  compare and select the  best model .
Use the model to make "model.pkl"  file .
Write the code to show the output of your model using the test dataset.
 You can use all these models on this dataset  and check accuracy :-
    'Logistic Regression' ,
    'Naive Bayes',
    'Support Vector Machine'
    'K-Nearest Neighbors',
    'Decision Tree',
    'Random Forest'
    'Bagging',
    'Gradient Boosting'
